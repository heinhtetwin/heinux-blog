My name is Hein Htet Win and I currently lives in Myanmar. I am currently working as a freelancer and also learning a lot of technology related topics. I love open-source and therefore, I like working with Linux. As a self-paced learner, I decided to go for some IT certifications to get tested myself and I'd like to go for much more in the future. Here are some of my achievements to share with you: 

- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator by Linux Foundation](https://www.credly.com/badges/975edf51-0c27-4d85-a484-fb4e0a31c9df/public_url)
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/25bb026f-c522-4740-975b-f46313526899/public_url)
- [Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator](https://www.credly.com/badges/1835cbba-4189-4239-a1f1-8adcd202447c/public_url)

So, by any chances, if you are looking forward to take these exams or any other IT related certifications, you can come to me and discuss about how to **self-learn** and where to look for resources for a quick and efficient learning. 

### My story

I started learning Linux and other DevOps tools at the age of 21 I guess. Now I am learning about these technologies about 3 years and I have intermediate level of knowledge in areas like Linux, Docker, Kubernetes and CICD tools. So, if you want to, you can discuss with me or ask me anything u want to know. I will try my best to explain things if I already acknowledged that. Besides working as a IT personnel, I also enjoy playing competitive games like Dota2. I think that's pretty much about me.
Feel free to contact me if u need anything.
